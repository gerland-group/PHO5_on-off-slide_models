# MATLAB code for Effective Dynamics of Nucleosome Configurations at the Yeast PHO5 Promoter

This repository contains code used in our paper "Effective Dynamics of Nucleosome Configurations at the Yeast PHO5 Promoter". A preprint can be found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.072470v1.

### Usage

1) Run MP_combined_fit_run_locally.m (calculates models up to certain complexity and fits them to the first data set)

2) Run MP_combined_fit_analysis_all_data.m (stage 2 and stage 3 fits with analysis plots)
